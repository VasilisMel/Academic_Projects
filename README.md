## 2D image brain segmentation z axis in 3D view 

Developed a Deep Image segmentation system that identifies and segments different categories of tumors from brain tumor images via MATLAB for preprocessing and Python for Deep Learning segmentation through [Keras image segmentation library](https://github.com/divamgupta/image-segmentation-keras/). The dataset used for this project is available [here](https://figshare.com/articles/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427/).

## Heat pain Classification from video samples
In a team of 2 we established an CNN approach to classify the pain of patients that were involved in a pain experiment that a heat device is mounted on their hand. The dataset used for this project is available [here](http://www.iikt.ovgu.de/BioVid.print).

## ROS - Controlling a robot with manual and automatic services based on computer vision.
This project is to execute four tasks using TurtleBot 3 mobile robot and simulation performing them on the [Construct Web Platform](https://www.theconstructsim.com/).
Project challenges:
- Create a script that moves the robot around with simple topic publishing.
- Generate the full map of the map and then localize the Turtlebot3 robot.
- Set up an automatic system that provides the robot to move from its position to a goal without colliding with any object.
- Set up an automatic system that allows the robot to move from its position to a set of waypoints.

## ROS Visual Servoing
In this project, the aim is to develop an automatic system by monitoring the movement of a robot with an eye-in-hand camera. The robot was able to be monitored by implementing Computer Vision in Python.

## Histogram specification for MRI image enhancement
This project aims to highlight any medical image using a variety of published techniques which were re-implemented from scratch for research and academic purposes. The core of this project is based on Histogram specification, which is a useful technique of histogram modification for image enhancement.

## Raspberry pi IoT project
This project’s goal was to implement a remote system where the Raspberry Pi would be controlled via cloud MQTT connection. This system can provide a set of services:
- File Encryption and Decryption
- Auto Cloud service file storage
- Computer Vision operations ( QR code decryption and Real-time Edge Detection)
