<h2>2D-image-brain-segmentation--z-axis--in-3D-view 
</h2>
Developed a Deep Image segmentation system that identifies and segments different categories of tumors from brain tumor images via MATLAB for preprocessing and Python for Deep Learning segmentation through [Keras image segmentation library](https://github.com/divamgupta/image-segmentation-keras). The dataset used for this project is available [here](https://figshare.com/articles/brain_tumor_dataset/1512427).
